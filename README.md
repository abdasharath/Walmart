# Walmart - Confidence Interval and CLT
## Problem Statement
Walmart is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of supercenters, discount departmental stores, and grocery stores from the United States. Walmart has more than 100 million customers worldwide.
The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Assume 50 million customers are male and 50 million arefemale).

## Business Insights:
* Most of the users are Male with 75.3 % of users. Males clearly purchase more than females.
* There are 21 and 20 different types of Occupation and Product_Category respectively.
* More users belong to B City_Category with count of 42%.
* More users are Single as compare to Married.
* Most purchases are made from the age group of 26-35

* Average purchase of male is 9437.52 and female is 8734.56
* Majority of Customers purchase within the 5,000 - 20,000 range.
* The majority of our customers come from city category B but customers come from City category C spent more as mean is 9719
* The majority of users come from City Category C, but more people from City Category B tend to purchase, which suggests the same users visit the mall multiple times in City Category B.

## Recommendations
* Men spent more money than women, So company should focus on retaining the male customers and getting more male customers.
* Add some more products based on female to attract the female customers.
* Most no of purchases are made in the age group of (26-35) so in order to attract other age groups has to increase the products relative to their age.
* Product_Category - 1, 5, 8, & 11 have highest purchasing frequency. It means these are the products in these categories are liked more by customers.So increase these products and also try to replace the products of low purchase with a new product which will be like the 1,5,8,11 category types.
* Mostly Unmarried customers made more purchase in order to increase the married customer sales try to implement new products based on the family products.
* The management should have some offers on kids (0-17 years) in order to increase sales.
* More purchases are made in city B so have to keep some offers in remaining cities to increase sales.
* Try to implement some type of games,food courts in malls which will be good to attract the children.
